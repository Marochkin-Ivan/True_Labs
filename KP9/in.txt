aaaaah Let me not to the marriage of true minds
aaacge Admit impediments. Love is not love
aaeaff Which alters when it alteration finds,
aaertn Or bends with the remover to remove.
aaerwa O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
aafage That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
aafbbt It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
aaianh Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
aekush Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
ekvape Within his bending sickle's compass come;
dayana Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
dscott But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
zvagid If this be error and upon me prov'd,
wbenzo I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
